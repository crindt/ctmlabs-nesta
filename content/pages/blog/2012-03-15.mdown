# Updated CTMLabs website goes live

We've moved the CTMLabs portal website from a [drupal] install to
[nesta].  Nesta, a ruby-based content management system designed for
mostly static content fits our use-case much better than php-based
drupal.

[drupal]: http://drupal.org
[nesta]: http://nestacms.com
