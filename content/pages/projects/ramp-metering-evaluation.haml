            ### What is the Ramp Meter Evaluation Platform?

            The product allows engineers, researchers, and managers to
            display, evaluate, and analyze the performance of current
            ramp metering operation through a web interface.

            ### What does it do?

            The product can be used to display the operation of ramp
            meters based on real-time and historical ramp metering
            data collected from the field controllers. It can be used
            to show the performance of the meters in terms of queue
            override, ramp flow, metering rate, etc. It also provides
            functions to analyze the performance of ramp metering
            control. For example, frequent queue override may indicate
            continuous high demands or inappropriate metering rate
            setup. The frequent use of time-of-day metering rate
            instead of traffic responsive metering rate may indicate
            inappropriate settings for traffic responsive metering
            parameters.

            ### What is the current status?

            CTMLabs is currently receiving ramp metering related data
            together with loop detector data from the field
            controllers every 30 sec. Researchers are in the process
            of parsing these data that will need to be saved to the
            database. The ramp metering related data have been
            analyzed based on the SATMS protocol and some sample data.
            Researchers have roughly designed the web interfaces and
            started coding the web-based program.

            ### Who are the customers?

            Ramp metering traffic engineers can use this system to
            check the performance of current meters and fine-tune
            their performance by analyzing historical ramp metering
            data.  Managers can thus know the capabilities of the
            existing metering system and allocate resources to utilize
            this freeway control method for freeway operation
            improvement.

            ### What roadblocks are preventing Caltrans wide implementation?

            Although Caltrans has spent a lot of resources to seek the
            improvement of ramp metering system, the performance and
            capabilities of the existing meters are not investigated
            based on available data.

            According to District 12 and 7â€™s SATMS system, ramp
            metering data are collected and sent to TMC together with
            loop detector data. Detector data have been widely
            used. But, ramp metering data have been forgotten.

            ### Who are your current partners?

            Outside Caltrans:

            * California Center for Innovative Transportation, University of California at Berkeley
            * Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California at Irvine

            Within Caltrans District 12:

            * Mort Fahrtash, Caltrans/D12 TSD
            * Zhongren Wang, Caltrans HQ
            * Herasmo Iniguez, Caltrans HQ

            ### What partners are missing?

            Extending the system to other Caltrans Districts would
            require ramp metering traffic managers and engineers from
            other Caltrans districts and decision makers from
            headquarters.

            ### What resources are needed to move forward?

            Extending the system to other districts would require a
            commitment by participating districts to provide access to
            ramp metering data received from the field controllers. In
            addition, developers need to analyze the ramp metering
            data contents from other districts.  Some time would be
            needed to alter the system to work with the (almost
            certainly) altered data sources. The amount of developer
            time would depend on how much the processes and software
            differ from the current systems in use at Caltrans
            District 12.
